# Reaper-Playback-half-speed
Wrote a script that plays back at half speed and then resets the playrate to 1

#
Playback rate resets when the assigned key bind is pressed and also when spacebar is pressed. Have to set "New Instance" and check the "Remember my anwer for this script" in the dialogue box
