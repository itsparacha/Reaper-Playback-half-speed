# Shah_Playathalfspeed.lua
Wrote a script that plays back at half speed and then resets the playrate to 1

# Shah_Playathalfspeed_v2.0.lua
Playback rate resets when the assigned key bind is pressed and also when spacebar is pressed. Have to set "Terminate Instance" and check the "Remember my anwer for this script" in the dialogue box

# Shah_Playathalfspeed_v2.6.lua
  - Toggles half-speed playback
  - Resets to normal when stopped manually (e.g., spacebar)
